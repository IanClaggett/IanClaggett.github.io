The first of these design implementations would be the centralization of weight and balance along the body of the AEV. This design was drafted to maintain its balance and control on the track to remove the possibility of the AEV derailing from the track. This was accomplished by mirroring the propeller layout and wing layout on both sides, as well as distributing the servo motor, Arduino motherboard, monorail clamp, and battery back between both front and back of the AEV. This created an equilibrium of weight distribution which helped ensure the vehicle would stay on the track. Another important design implementation would be the condensed body the AEV utilizes. The body of the vehicle is light and small, allowing for a much more energy efficient build while the AEV travels uphill. Finally, the AEV features a hook drilled into the servo motor fin, bent into a lock to remove the possibility of the hook detaching itself. This design allows for the AEV to pull the cart without breaking or removing the hook from the AEV, stranding the passenger cart.
